Hi! Our project is a game inspired by the mean girls movie and the RoseHack Hackathon 2024! Its fun, intercative, coded through python, and incorporates themes of teamwork and collaboration. 
Additionally, our project is the first ever project our whole team has done with this being our first hackathon. Therefore, our team also did not know the rule of everyone being there for judging, and we couldn't qualify for the prizes due to a part of our team being unavailable at that time.
