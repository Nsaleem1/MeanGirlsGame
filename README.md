Our project is a game inspired by the Mean Girls movie and RoseHack 2024! We used renpy and python to bring this game come to life. We wanted to do something fun for the cyberpunk theme of the hackathon. This was the first hackathon for every member of our team, and the first computer science project produced by each of us.
